 - **Please note that it is currently under development but you can use the code right now(only in replit) if you want to try it out. I'm currently dealing with some issues that prevent this bot to be available to the world. The code in `main.py` is just a prototype which is prior to change. Well, I will release the updated and the new model on here when I complete coding it. 😃**

  - `.hi`: Say hello to the bot!
  - `.quote`: Receive a random motivational quote.
  - `.encourage`: Get an encouraging message when you need it.

# Coming Soon 🔜

- **Server-Specific Configuration**: Admins or users with Manage Permissions can configure the bot for their server.

- **New Commands**: To add more commands relating to study purposes like to-do lists, reminders etc....
- **Human Feeling Detector**: To detect the emotions or feelings of the user, and reply with something according to the situation.


# Current Status 📊
- I am currently not coding the bot because I have other work to do.
- I assure that if I have time, I'll update the code and make the bot online and worldwide.
- I just need time as I have school.
- But hey, I'll keep you updated about what is happening.
- This bot will probably be up before 14.10.2024(I guess so, 😆)
- That's it about the bot.
